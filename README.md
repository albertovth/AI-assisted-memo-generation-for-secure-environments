# AI-Assisted Memo Generation for Secure Environments

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project explores the use of pre-trained transformer models for automated memo and report generation, at the same time data privacy for sensitive organizational information is maintained. 

## Background

Organizations are increasingly turning to AI to automate routine tasks. 
Several tools have become readily available to train generative language models, with organizational or private data.
This possibility opens for large potential efficiency gains for organizations, particularly those that depend on document generation,
like memos, reports, correspondence and analysis.
However, the use of cloud-based AI services raises concerns about data privacy, especially for sensitive information.
The following points summarize the project:

* Organizations who store sensitive information on cloud servers, increase the risk of exposing this information
* At the same time, the potential benefits of AI create a desire for AI capabilities
* This creates a need for secure, AI-powered document generation, either on-premises or externally

This project is driven by the need to balance the efficiency gains from AI with the imperative of data security. 

## How is it used?

The solution involves two main alternative approaches:
i) Partnering with AI-providers, to create secure processing infrastructures.
ii) Investing in on-premises hardware, to host and train AI-models in-house.

This solution is necessary in environments where data sensitivity is paramount, such as government agencies or healthcare providers. 
Users would be organizational staff who require secure and efficient document creation.

Images and diagrams of the system architecture can help visualize the setup and workflow.

## Data sources and AI-methods

Data would come from the organization's own archives, ensuring that all sensitive information remains within a secure perimeter. 

Pre-trained models from sources that allow on-premises deployment would be utilized to tailor the solution to specific needs.

## Challenges

This project does not address the cost and expertise needed to set up in-house AI infrastructures, or the complexities of international data privacy laws. Ethical considerations include potential misuse of AI-generated documents and ensuring that AI-generated texts are clearly identified as such.

## What next?

To expand this project, collaboration with cybersecurity experts and legal advisors would be necessary. 
Further development could also involve creating more sophisticated models tailored to different types of documents and organizational needs.
